# Contributing

First of all, thanks for taking the time to submit a pull request! These are some requirements and guidelines to keep things coherent.

1. Fork the project and clone locally.
2. Install dev dependencies.
3. Create a feature branch to add your new functionality or fix a bug.
4. Add or modify tests as necessary. NOTE: PRs that come without tests or break current ones can't be accepted.
5. Make sure you rebase / pull latest changes from upstream master and that everything works as expected.
6. Push your branch and submit a pull request with a description of your proposed changes and why they are needed.

We will review the changes as soon as possible.

Thanks!
