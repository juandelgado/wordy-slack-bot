# Wordy

Wordy is a Slack bot that helps you stay clear of common, but emotionally charged for some, words.

Some examples are "guys" or ableisms such as "mad", "crazy", etc.

For now you can have a read at [WeAllJS take on it](http://wealljs.org/rfc-slackbot-language-shorthands):

> The enforcement process [...] is focused around being kind, and on accepting corrections and moving on peacefully.
